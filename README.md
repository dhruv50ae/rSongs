# React Songs

- Real project with React Redux. This is VERY overkill Redux, you would never see this but to demonstrate Redux skills, I created a music displaying application.

## Description

- You would use the props system to pass down the songs and it's data to display it
- Used Redux instead to show data
- Used Semantic UI to give the clean UI
- Simple UX
- Provider feeds information to App so the data is global in that sense
